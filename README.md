This project is in its early stages, originally inspired by Jed Jubranâ€™s javascript course. The style has been modified to reflect a unique design approach. Upcoming phases will focus on expanding functionality, improving user experience, and integrating Java and Spring for backend support to transition this into a full-stack application.
