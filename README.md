# Name Variations Project

This project is in its initial phase, inspired by Jed Jubran's frontend development course. The current design has been adapted to align with a unique, Ubuntu-inspired theme. The goal is to develop a name analyzer tool that displays various string manipulations and character insights in real-time.

## Current Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Analyze a name as you type, with information like:
    - Character count
    - First and last character
    - Lowercase and uppercase transformations
    - Capitalization
- **Responsive UI**: Styled with a clean, dark theme and contrasting colors for better readability and a modern look.
## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Git
- GitHub for version control

## Future Plans

1. **Enhanced Functionality**: Add more interactive features and options for name analysis.
2. **Java & Spring Integration**: Transform the project into a full-stack application by connecting it to a Java and Spring-based backend, allowing for expanded data handling and processing.
